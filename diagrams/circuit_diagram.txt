POWER SUPPLY:
------------
9V Battery:

- Negative (-) -> L293D/L298N GND and Arduino GND

WIRING NOTES:
------------
1. Keep power wires (red/black) separate from signal wires when possible
2. Use thicker gauge wires for motor connections to handle higher current
3. Add 0.1Î¼F ceramic capacitors across each motor's terminals to reduce noise
4. Consider adding a power switch between the battery and the circuit
5. For more stable operation, use a separate battery for the Arduino

MOTOR CONFIGURATION DETAILS:
--------------------------
The motors are wired in parallel on each side to increase torque:

Left Side Configuration:
- Motors 1 & 2 are wired in parallel but with opposite polarity
- This ensures both motors on the left side rotate in the same direction
- When OUT1 is HIGH and OUT2 is LOW, both left motors move forward

Right Side Configuration:
- Motors 3 & 4 are wired in parallel but with opposite polarity
- This ensures both motors on the right side rotate in the same direction
- When OUT3 is HIGH and OUT4 is LOW, both right motors move forward

SENSOR POSITIONING:
-----------------
IR Sensors:
- Mount at the front of the robot, pointing downward
- Height: 2-3 cm from the ground
- Spacing: 3-4 cm apart (adjust based on line width)
- Angle: Perpendicular to the ground for best readings

Ultrasonic Sensor:
- Mount at the front center of the robot
- Height: Approximately at the middle of expected obstacles
- Angle: Parallel to the ground, pointing forward
- Ensure no robot parts obstruct the sensor's view

POWER CONSIDERATIONS:
-------------------
- The L293D can handle up to 600mA per channel
- The L298N can handle up to 2A per channel
- For higher current motors, use the L298N
- Ensure your battery can provide sufficient current (at least 1A)
- A 9V alkaline battery may not provide enough current for extended operation
- Consider using a LiPo battery pack or multiple AA batteries in series
